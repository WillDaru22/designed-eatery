## Notes
Program was testing and confirmed working across Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Display size issues should be resolved and did not appear on CS Lab Machines.  However, screen sizes that are out of budget to test may display differently.

## Program Use
Buttons work as described.  To filter, click on either Name or Nutrient to set rules.  Name will accept one rule, Nutrient will accept any number of rules that you wish to add.  To apply the filter query, click Apply.  To reset the query, click Reset.
